# How to use plugins

Every command has a dedicated directory, in it you (sometimes) can find configurations files or a .md file.
Before enabling the plugins you should read the md file and follow the istruction (if there is one).

You can easily toggle the plugins by removing them from the folder plugins.

In the near future I'll add an explanation for each command.
