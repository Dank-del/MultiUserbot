# Weather
Display the weather for a city

### Needed setup
- Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/ and register an account for free.
- Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and, if needed, login and take the free api key
- Open `apikey.ini` with your favourite editor and add your api key

*Note: This step might not be necessary but it's suggested as the shared api key could get blocked, limiited or just disabled by an high request number*

*Other Note: This is going to change really soon to drop the useless city.json file*
